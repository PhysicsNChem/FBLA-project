# FBLA-project
A program that helps students manage their personal finances by tracking account 
balances, income and expenses. The program will allow users to input details about their 
income sources and expenses, including the amount, category, and date of each transaction. 
It will provide features to view the current balance, generate summaries of income and 
expenses over specified periods (e.g., weekly, monthly), and categorize expenses to show 
spending patterns. Additionally, the program will include functionality to update or delete 
existing entries and offer search and filter options to easily find specific transactions.
